    <p class="aboutMe">
        For all intents and purposes, I'm going to assume that honesty is more productive for both you and myself; I'm not going to try and sugar coat myself.  Please, do not read this as rude.  Though brusque, I try to respect people's time.
        <br><br>
        I am me and I am weird.  Probably due to me being on the spectrum.  If not that, then being a recovered alcoholic that hit rock bottom in a hospital psych ward will do strange things to the mind; strange, yet beneficial in my case.
        <br><br>
        I am given to believe that these things allows me a unique perspective and I often consider challenges, notions, objects, perspectives, etc. in many facets before proceeding.  I am a natural problem solver, in that way.  My main problem solving tenent is, "apply precisely the exact amount of force required."
        <br><br>
        Easier said than done, proceeding through life with this mentality requires that I be an adept learner and I believe my ability to learn is far above average.  I would call these my main two assets to any project.  By my innate desire to learn, I am adaptable.  By my innate desire to problem solve, I'm genuinely interested in projects and attempting to produce the best, practical results.
        <br><br>
        Though somewhat callous, I do possess a desire to either create or assist in creating a healthy work environment.  Nasty things happen to combustion engines when proper oiling is neglected.  I will never defraud myself for the sake of others, yet, I am not a stubborn asshole that is immune to behavioral changes for the sake of a workplace.

    <div class=gHeader>Education</div>
    <p class="education">
        I finished Highschool easy enough.  Before running off to college I 
        held a few basic jobs.
        <br><br>
        I worked for a minor amount of time at my father's clothing store.
        <br><br>
        I also worked for a window tinting store that was run by a crook.
        <br><br>
        Then I worked for Bestbuy as a salesman.
        <br><br>
        After which, I ran off to college and managed to complete a single year before having a breakdown.
        <br><br>
	    Post college is where I accrued the majority of my work, "experience," as I went back to my father's clothing store for several years ... before having--you guessed it--another mental breakdown. 
        <br><br>
        This will be the first time I'll have held a job in which I hold genuine interest and ambition.
